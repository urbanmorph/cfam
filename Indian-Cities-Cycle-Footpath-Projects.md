## Investment Context

### Metro Rail Investment (comparison)

| Period | Investment | Details | Source |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Since 2010 | ₹20 trillion ($25 billion) | Metro rail systems | [ITDP India Walking Cycling Revolution](https://itdp.org/2023/01/05/india-walking-cycling-revolution-stmag-34/) |
| Through 2026 | ₹3 trillion projected | Ongoing metro development | [ITDP India Walking Cycling Revolution](https://itdp.org/2023/01/05/india-walking-cycling-revolution-stmag-34/) |

**Key Issue**: Last-mile connectivity and multimodal integration remain major challenges despite significant metro investment.

## Methodology Notes

**Data Collection Period**: January-February 2026

**Search Methodology**:
- Web search across official government sources (MoHUA, Smart Cities Mission)
- International development organization reports (ITDP, GIZ)
- Academic and policy research sources (ORF, CEPT University)
- News and press releases from government agencies

**Data Limitations**:
- Specific city-by-city breakdowns not available for all 117 participating cities
- Some projects report combined statistics for multiple cities
- Budget figures not publicly disclosed for most city-level projects
- Many cities report qualitative participation without quantitative metrics
