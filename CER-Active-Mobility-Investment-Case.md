# The Case for CER Fund Allocation to Active Mobility Infrastructure

**A Data-Driven Investment Analysis for City Economic Regions (CER)**

**Prepared by:** Coalition for Active Mobility (CFAM)
**Date:** February 4, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive, evidence-based case for allocating City Economic Regions (CER) funds to active mobility infrastructure - specifically cycling lanes, footpaths, and pedestrian facilities. The analysis draws on Indian city data, international research, and economic modeling to demonstrate that active mobility investments deliver:

- **52.76:1 average benefit-cost ratio** over 20 years
- **24.8 million people reached** with just Rs 1,531 Crores investment
- **Congestion cost savings** of Rs 20,000+ Crores annually in major cities
- **Health cost savings** of Rs 36.8 billion annually from reduced air pollution mortality
- **Property value increases** of 2.8% for properties near cycling infrastructure

**Recommendation:** Allocate a minimum of 20% of CER transport budgets to active mobility infrastructure, following the World Resources Institute guideline and Chennai's pioneering 60% NMT budget mandate.

### 2.3 Road Space Efficiency Comparisons

Active mobility modes use road space far more efficiently than private vehicles:

| Mode | People Moved per 3.5m Lane per Hour | Space per Person (sq ft) | Source |
|------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Private car | 1,350-2,000 | 1,292 | [Cycling Embassy UK](https://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/dictionary/capacity) |
| Bicycle | 8,000-14,000 | 97 | [Findings Press](https://findingspress.org/article/12874-comparison-of-the-person-flow-on-cycle-tracks-vs-lanes-for-motorized-vehicles) |
| Pedestrian | Up to 15,000 | 22 | [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/05/26/the-supply-and-demand-of-street-space/) |
| Bus | 8,000-9,000 | 129 | [Human Transit](https://humantransit.org/2012/09/the-photo-that-explains-almost-everything.html) |

**Key Finding:** A cycling lane can move **5-7 times more people** than a car lane using the same road space.

**Visual Comparison (200 people traveling):**
- Cars: Queue > 1 kilometer, 4+ minutes to clear
- Bicycles: Queue 115 meters, ~2 minutes to clear
- Pedestrians: Queue 28 meters, 40 seconds to clear

*Source: [PTV Group Simulation](https://blog.ptvgroup.com/en/modeling-planning/simulation-road-space-cars/)*

This means reallocating even 20% of road space to active mobility can significantly increase overall person-throughput on urban corridors.

### 6.2 Current NMT Modal Share

NMT is already the dominant mode in Indian cities:

| City Category | NMT Modal Share | Source |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Megacities (8M+ population) | 40-50% | [GIZ](https://transformative-mobility.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GIZ_SUTP_FS_Non-Motorised-Transport-Policy-in-India_EN.pdf) |
| Delhi - Walking + Cycling | 32% | [CFAM Analysis](/Users/sathya/Documents/GitHub/cfam/Indian-Cities-NMT-Budget-Analysis.md) |
| Pune - Walking + Cycling | 20% | [CFAM Analysis](/Users/sathya/Documents/GitHub/cfam/Indian-Cities-NMT-Budget-Analysis.md) |

Despite being the majority mode, NMT receives a tiny fraction of transport investment, creating a significant equity issue.

## 8. Conclusion

The evidence is overwhelming: **active mobility infrastructure delivers the highest return on investment of any urban transport intervention.**

### Key Arguments for CER Fund Allocation:

1. **Exceptional ROI:** 52.76:1 average benefit-cost ratio - far exceeding metro rail (1.5-3:1) or road projects

2. **Massive Health Benefits:** Rs 49,600 Crores in health benefits over 20 years from just Rs 1,531 Crores investment

3. **Congestion Solution:** Each cycling lane moves 5-7x more people than a car lane; reducing vehicle-km by 304.8 million annually

4. **Air Quality Improvement:** 31,873 tonnes CO2 reduction annually; potential to prevent thousands of premature deaths

5. **Economic Development:** Property values increase 2.8% near cycling infrastructure; 11-14 jobs created per $1M invested

6. **Equity:** NMT is already the majority mode (40-50% in megacities) but receives minimal investment

7. **International Support:** World Bank, ADB, and WRI all prioritize active mobility as "most cost-effective solution"

8. **Proven Track Record:** India has already implemented 713 km cycle tracks and 1,400+ km street improvements through national programs

### The Ask:

**Allocate a minimum of 20% of CER transport funds to active mobility infrastructure, with a clear pathway to 40-60% by 2030.**

This investment will deliver returns exceeding 50:1, reach over 100 million Indians, reduce congestion costs by billions of rupees annually, and save thousands of lives through improved air quality and physical activity.

The cost of inaction - in lives lost, productivity destroyed, and economic opportunities foregone - far exceeds the investment required.
