          "text": "Active mobility refers to human-powered transportation including walking, cycling, using wheelchairs, and other non-motorized forms of movement. In India, it accounts for 40-60% of all trips but receives less than 10% of transport infrastructure budgets. Active mobility is essential for health, environmental sustainability, and equitable urban development."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Vehicular cycling is the practice of cyclists riding in general traffic lanes following the same rules as motor vehicles. This approach is inappropriate for India because: it only appeals to confident, experienced cyclists (typically young males), it excludes children, elderly, women, and risk-averse users, it doesn't reduce traffic fatalities, and international evidence shows protected infrastructure is necessary for mass cycling adoption. Countries with high cycling rates (Netherlands, Denmark) reject vehicular cycling."

          "text": "Vision Zero is a road safety philosophy originating in Sweden that accepts zero traffic deaths and serious injuries as the only acceptable goal. Key principles: human life takes priority over mobility, humans make mistakes and are fragile, system designers are responsible for safety not individual users, and speed management is critical (impact at 50 km/h is often fatal, at 30 km/h most survive). Vision Zero cities redesign streets with protected infrastructure, lower speed limits, and safer intersections."

Studies show 10% mode shift to cycling can reduce urban PM2.5 by 5-8%."

Requirements: protected cycling infrastructure (not painted lanes), low-speed traffic (30 km/h in residential areas), protected intersections with clear sight lines, accessible design (no stairs, gentle slopes), safe crossings with adequate crossing time, continuous networks without gaps, and intuitive wayfinding. Infrastructure safe only for 'strong and fearless' cyclists fails this test."

Developed in Netherlands, now adopted globally. Reduces cyclist injuries at intersections by 70-90% compared to conventional designs."

                      Active mobility refers to human-powered transportation including walking, cycling, using wheelchairs, and other non-motorized forms of movement. In India, it accounts for 40-60% of all trips but receives less than 10% of transport infrastructure budgets. Active mobility is essential for health, environmental sustainability, and equitable urban development.

                      India records 1.5 lakh (150,000) road deaths annually according to Ministry of Road Transport and Highways data. Of these, <strong>60% are pedestrians and cyclists</strong> who are vulnerable road users lacking proper infrastructure. This makes India's roads among the most dangerous in the world for people walking and cycling.
