# National Active Mobility Bill - Budget Allocation Proposal

**Prepared for:** Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA)
**Subject:** Budgetary Framework for National Active Mobility Bill Implementation
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Status:** Draft for Parliamentary Review

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive budgetary framework for implementing the National Active Mobility Bill across Indian cities. Drawing from Union Budget 2026-27 allocations, existing urban transport programs, and performance-based grant systems, we propose a **Rs 20,000 Crore (5-year)** dedicated Active Mobility Fund to be administered by MoHUA.

### Key Recommendations

| Recommendation | Quantum | Justification |
|----------------|---------|---------------|
| **Minimum CER Allocation to Active Mobility** | 20% of transport budget | Cities spend <5% currently; Chennai's 60% model shows viability |
| **Dedicated Active Mobility Fund** | Rs 20,000 Cr (5 years) | Covers 117 cities at Rs 170 Cr average per city |
| **Performance-Based Grants** | 70% of allocation | Rewards cities achieving targets; follows Smart Cities model |
| **Pilot Program (5 cities)** | Rs 1,531 Cr (Year 1) | Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad |
| **Expected National ROI** | 45:1 over 20 years | Based on ITDP model calibrated for Indian cities |

### 1.2 MoHUA Transport & Mobility Budget

| Program | FY 2026-27 Allocation | FY 2025-26 (Comparison) | Change |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Total MoHUA** | Rs 85,522 Cr | Rs 96,777 Cr | -11.6% |
| **Metro Rail/MRTS** | Rs 28,740 Cr | Rs 34,807 Cr | -17.4% |
| **PM eBus Sewa** | Rs 1,310 Cr | Rs 1,310 Cr | 0% |
| **AMRUT 2.0** | Rs 8,000 Cr | Rs 10,000 Cr | -20% |
| **Urban Challenge Fund** | Rs 10,000 Cr | Rs 10,000 Cr | Not implemented |
| **Active Mobility/NMT** | **NIL** | **NIL** | **No dedicated line item** |

#### Critical Gap Identified:
Despite **54% of Indian commuters** relying on walking/cycling and **40-50% NMT modal share in megacities**, there is **NO dedicated budget allocation** for cycling infrastructure, pedestrian footpaths, or non-motorized transport in Union Budget 2026-27.

## 2. Economic Case for Active Mobility Investment

### 2.1 Return on Investment Analysis

Based on ITDP Protected Bicycle Lane Network Impact Model applied to 5 Indian cities:

| City | Investment (₹ Cr) | 20-Year Benefits (₹ Cr) | Benefit-Cost Ratio |
|------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Delhi NCR | 228.0 | 26,540.8 | **116.41:1** |

- **50%+ of workers in many cities** depend on NMT (Census 2011)
- **Low-income households** spend 20-40% of income on transport

#### Active Mobility Benefits:
- **Rs 617 per person reached** (vs Rs 10,000+ for metro)
- **No fare barrier** - infrastructure accessible to all
- **Women's safety:** Well-lit, wide footpaths reduce harassment
- **Persons with disabilities:** Accessible infrastructure mandated in NAMo Bill

## 3. Proposed Budget Allocation Framework

### 3.1 Five-Year Budget Proposal

| Year | Cities Covered | Total Allocation (₹ Cr) | Central Share (₹ Cr) | State/ULB Share (₹ Cr) |
|------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Year 1 (2026-27)** | 5 pilot cities | 1,531 | 1,225 (80%) | 306 (20%) |
| **Year 2 (2027-28)** | 15 cities | 4,000 | 2,800 (70%) | 1,200 (30%) |
| **Year 3 (2028-29)** | 30 cities | 5,500 | 3,850 (70%) | 1,650 (30%) |
| **Year 4 (2029-30)** | 40 cities | 5,500 | 3,300 (60%) | 2,200 (40%) |
| **Year 5 (2030-31)** | 27 cities | 3,469 | 2,081 (60%) | 1,388 (40%) |
| **TOTAL** | **117 cities** | **20,000** | **13,256** | **6,744** |

#### Rationale:
- **117 cities:** All participants in India Cycles4Change and Streets4People Challenges
- **Phased approach:** Pilot → Scale → Sustain
- **Decreasing central share:** Builds state/ULB capacity and ownership
- **Performance-linked:** Cities achieving targets get priority in subsequent years

### 3.2 CER Fund Routing to Active Mobility

#### Proposed Allocation from CER Budget:

| CER | Annual Transport Budget (Est.) | Active Mobility (20%) | 5-Year AM Allocation |
|-----|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Bengaluru | Rs 200 Cr | Rs 40 Cr | Rs 200 Cr |
| Pune | Rs 180 Cr | Rs 36 Cr | Rs 180 Cr |
| Coimbatore-Erode-Tiruppur | Rs 150 Cr | Rs 30 Cr | Rs 150 Cr |
| Surat | Rs 150 Cr | Rs 30 Cr | Rs 150 Cr |
| Bhubaneswar-Puri-Cuttack | Rs 140 Cr | Rs 28 Cr | Rs 140 Cr |
| Visakhapatnam | Rs 120 Cr | Rs 24 Cr | Rs 120 Cr |
| Varanasi | Rs 100 Cr | Rs 20 Cr | Rs 100 Cr |
| **TOTAL** | **Rs 1,040 Cr/year** | **Rs 208 Cr/year** | **Rs 1,040 Cr** |

**Justification for 20% Allocation:**
1. **Chennai model:** Already mandates 60% of transport budget for NMT
2. **Current underspending:** Most cities spend <5% on NMT despite 40-50% modal share
3. **ROI differential:** Active mobility delivers 32-116:1 BCR vs 1.5-3:1 for metro
4. **Coverage:** 20% reaches 10x more people per rupee than metro investment

#### Pathway to 40-60% by 2030:
- **2026-27:** 20% minimum (NAMo Bill compliance)
- **2028-29:** 30% for cities achieving targets
- **2030-31:** 40-60% for best performers (Chennai model)

### 3.3 Additional Funding Sources

#### Central Government Sources:

| Source | Quantum Available | Proposed AM Allocation | Mechanism |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **CER (7 cities)** | Rs 5,000 Cr/CER | 20% of transport = Rs 1,040 Cr | Budget mandate |
| **Urban Challenge Fund** | Rs 1 lakh Cr | 10% = Rs 10,000 Cr | Last-mile connectivity projects |
| **PM eBus Sewa** | Rs 20,000 Cr | 5% = Rs 1,000 Cr | Feeder cycling/walking to bus stops |
| **AMRUT 2.0** | Rs 2,99,000 Cr | 3% = Rs 8,970 Cr | NMT already eligible category |
| **Green Urban Mobility (GUMP)** | EUR 2 billion target | 30% = EUR 600M | Bilateral climate financing |
| **Total Potential** | - | **Rs 21,010 Cr** | Over 5 years |

#### State/ULB Sources:
- **Property Tax:** Earmark 5% for footpath maintenance
- **Parking Fees:** 100% for NMT infrastructure in same area

## 9. Conclusion

The National Active Mobility Bill presents a historic opportunity to correct decades of car-centric urban planning and invest in infrastructure that serves the majority of Indians. With **54% of commuters relying on walking/cycling** but receiving **<5% of transport budgets**, the case for dedicated active mobility funding is irrefutable.

This proposal outlines a **Rs 20,000 Crore (5-year) investment** that would:
- Deliver **45:1 return on investment** over 20 years
- Reach **100+ million people** across 117 cities
- Prevent **12,000+ road deaths** annually by 2031
- Reduce **45 MtCO2e** over project lifecycle
- Save **Rs 50,000 Crores** in healthcare costs

By routing **20% of CER transport budgets** to active mobility and leveraging existing programs (UCF, PM eBus Sewa, AMRUT), we can create a sustainable, equitable, and climate-resilient urban transport system.

**Recommendation:** Approve Rs 1,531 Crore pilot (5 cities) in FY 2026-27 and establish Active Mobility Cell in MoHUA to coordinate implementation.
