## Section 1: Constitutional Framework

### 1.1 Constitutional Basis for Central Legislation on Active Mobility

#### 1.1.1 Article 246 and the Seventh Schedule

The distribution of legislative powers between the Union and States in India is governed by [Article 246 of the Indian Constitution](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/77052/), which operates in conjunction with the Seventh Schedule. The Seventh Schedule contains three lists:

- **Union List (List I)**: 97 subjects on which only Parliament can legislate
- **State List (List II)**: 66 subjects on which only State Legislatures can legislate
- **Concurrent List (List III)**: 47 subjects on which both Parliament and State Legislatures can legislate

**Relevant entries for Active Mobility legislation:**

| List | Entry | Subject |
|------|-------|---------|
| Concurrent List | Entry 35 | Mechanically propelled vehicles including the principles on which taxes on such vehicles are to be levied |
| State List | Entry 13 | Roads, bridges, ferries, and other means of communication not specified in List I; municipal tramways; ropeways; inland waterways and traffic thereon |
| State List | Entry 5 | Local government, that is to say, the constitution and powers of municipal corporations, improvement trusts, districts boards, mining settlement authorities and other local authorities for the purpose of local self-government or village administration |

#### 1.1.2 How Transport Falls Under Both State and Central Jurisdiction

Transport occupies a unique position in India's federal structure:

1. **Roads and local transport infrastructure** are primarily State subjects under Entry 13 of the State List
2. **Mechanically propelled vehicles** fall under the Concurrent List (Entry 35)
3. **Urban local bodies** (which manage streets) are State subjects under Entry 5

Active mobility (walking and cycling) intersects with multiple entries:
- **Road design and infrastructure**: State subject (roads, bridges)
- **Vehicle regulations** (including cycles and e-bikes): Concurrent subject
- **Municipal functions**: State subject but governed by constitutional mandates under Part IXA (74th Amendment)

### 1.2 The Doctrine of Repugnancy (Article 254)

#### 1.2.1 General Rule - Central Law Prevails

[Article 254](https://www.constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-254-inconsistency-between-laws-made-by-parliament-and-laws-made-by-the-legislatures-of-states/) establishes the hierarchy when State and Central laws conflict on Concurrent List subjects:

> **Article 254(1)**: If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then... the law made by Parliament... shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.

**Key implications for a National Active Mobility Act:**
- If Parliament enacts a Central Active Mobility Act, it will prevail over any inconsistent State legislation
- States can still legislate on the subject, but their laws must not conflict with the Central Act
- State laws that existed before the Central Act become void to the extent of inconsistency

Source: [Doctrine of Repugnancy - Drishti Judiciary](https://www.drishtijudiciary.com/doctrines/constitution-of-india-doct/doctrine-of-repugnancy)

#### 1.2.2 Exception - State Law with Presidential Assent

**Article 254(2)** provides a critical exception:

> Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law... the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that State.

**Important caveats:**
- The State law only prevails in that particular State
- Parliament can subsequently enact legislation that overrides the State law
- Presidential assent must specifically address the repugnant provisions

### 1.3 The Doctrine of Occupied Field

The [Doctrine of Occupied Field](https://blog.ipleaders.in/doctrine-of-occupied-field/) is crucial for understanding how a Central Active Mobility Act would interact with State legislation:

#### 1.3.1 Core Principle

When Parliament legislates comprehensively on a subject in the Concurrent List, it "occupies the field," and States cannot enact laws that conflict with or obstruct the Central legislation.

**Key judicial interpretation** (M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India):
> "For the doctrine to apply, there must be a direct inconsistency between the central and state laws, making it impossible to obey both. If both laws can operate without conflict, the doctrine does not apply."

#### 1.3.2 Implications for Active Mobility Legislation

| Central Act Provisions | State Flexibility |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Minimum infrastructure standards | States can set HIGHER standards, not lower |
| Rights of pedestrians/cyclists | States cannot dilute these rights |
| Safety requirements | States can add requirements but not remove |
| Penalty provisions | States cannot reduce penalties (similar to Motor Vehicles Act) |
| Definitions | States must use consistent definitions |

### 1.4 The Motor Vehicles Act Model - A Precedent for Central-State Coordination

The [Motor Vehicles Act, 1988](https://morth.nic.in/motor-vehicles-act-1988) provides an excellent model for how a Central Active Mobility Act can be structured:

#### 1.4.1 Structure of the Motor Vehicles Act

| Component | Central Role | State Role |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Framework legislation | Parliament enacts the Act | States implement through State Transport Authorities |
| Rules | Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 | States can make additional rules not inconsistent with Central Rules |
| Penalties | Minimum penalties fixed by Central Act | States CANNOT reduce penalties (2019 Amendment controversy) |
| Implementation dates | Central Government notifies commencement | Different dates may be appointed for different States |
| Exemptions | Central Government can exempt categories | States cannot override Central exemptions |

#### 1.4.2 Lessons from MV Act Implementation

In 2019, when some States attempted to reduce traffic penalties below Central Act provisions, the [Attorney General's opinion](https://thelogicalindian.com/centre-state-mva-letter-2/) clarified:

> "The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (as amended by the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019) is a Parliamentary legislation, the state Governments cannot pass any law/ take executive action to lower the penalty fine below that prescribed under the statutory provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act unless the assent of the President is obtained to such state law."

**Enforcement mechanism:**
- Article 256 authorizes the Union to issue directions to States
- Disobedience can attract provisions of Article 356

Source: [Motor Vehicles Act - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Vehicles_Act)

### 1.5 Model for State Adoption and Customization

#### 1.5.1 The "Umbrella Legislation" Approach

Following the model of the [Environment (Protection) Act, 1986](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/4316/1/ep_act_1986.pdf), a Central Active Mobility Act can:

1. **Establish framework principles** that are binding nationwide
2. **Delegate specific powers** to State Governments
3. **Allow State rules** within the Central framework
4. **Reserve power** for Central Government to revoke delegation if necessary

#### 1.5.2 Recommended Central-State Division for Active Mobility

| Non-Negotiable Central Provisions | Provisions States Can Customize |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Definition of "pedestrian" and "cyclist" | Specific width requirements for local conditions |
| Fundamental rights of pedestrians/cyclists | Additional categories of protected users |
| Minimum infrastructure standards | Higher infrastructure standards |
| Penalty floors (minimum penalties) | Higher penalties |
| National design guidelines recognition | State-specific design adaptations |
| Mandatory provision for all new roads | Timelines for existing road upgrades |
| Grievance redressal requirements | Specific grievance mechanisms |

### 1.6 Constitutional Articles Summary

| Article | Relevance to National Active Mobility Act |
|---------|------------------------------------------|
| **Article 245** | Territorial extent of laws - Central Act applies throughout India |
| **Article 246** | Distribution of legislative powers - basis for Central legislation |
| **Article 253** | Legislation for implementing international agreements (relevant for Paris Agreement commitments on sustainable transport) |
| **Article 254** | Doctrine of repugnancy - Central law prevails over inconsistent State law |
| **Article 256** | Obligation of States to comply with Union laws |
| **Article 257** | Central Government can give directions to States |
| **Schedule VII** | Three lists defining Central, State, and Concurrent subjects |

## Conclusion

A National Active Mobility Act for India can successfully balance the need for uniform national standards with the flexibility required for State-level implementation. The constitutional framework, particularly Articles 246, 254, and the Seventh Schedule, provides clear guidance on how to structure such legislation.

By following the model of successful central legislation like the Motor Vehicles Act and Environment Protection Act, and drawing from international best practices across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, India can enact comprehensive active mobility legislation that:

1. **Establishes fundamental rights** for pedestrians and cyclists
2. **Mandates minimum infrastructure standards** that States cannot dilute
3. **Provides flexibility** for States to customize implementation
4. **Creates dedicated funding mechanisms** at all government levels
5. **Ensures effective enforcement** through clear penalty structures
6. **Promotes behavioral change** through education and awareness programs

The Karnataka Active Mobility Bill, 2022 provides an excellent foundation that can be adapted and strengthened for national application, incorporating proven innovations from cities worldwide.
