## Cost Assumptions & Methodology

### Infrastructure Costs (2025 Indian Context)

**Protected Cycle Lanes**: ₹50 lakhs per km (~$60,000/km)
- Physical segregation (bollards, planters, or kerbs)
- Road surface treatment/resurfacing
- Lane markings and signage
- Drainage modifications

**Improved Footpaths**: ₹30 lakhs per km (~$36,000/km)
- Paving/repaving with accessible materials
- Leveling and grading
- Tactile paving for accessibility
- Minor drainage works

**Ancillary Costs** (20% of infrastructure costs):
- Wayfinding signage
- Street furniture (benches, bicycle parking)
- Landscaping and greenery
- Traffic calming measures
- Public lighting improvements

### Benefits Calculation (20-Year Lifecycle)

**Carbon Benefits**
- Car: ~120g CO2/passenger-km reduced
- Motorcycle: ~80g CO2/passenger-km reduced
- Social cost of carbon: $50/tonne (~₹4,150/tonne)

**Health Benefits**
- Estimated ₹10,000 per person per year for regular cyclists
- Assumes 10% of people near bikeways become regular cyclists
- Accounts for reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, improved mental health

**Modal Shift Assumptions**
- Based on ITDP model calibration from Bogota and Guangzhou
- Modal shift from car: ~2.4%
- Modal shift from motorcycle: ~1.5%
- Average cycling distance: 315 km per person per year (for those near bikeways)

### Limitations

1. **Cost Variability**: Actual costs vary significantly by:
   - Street type (arterial vs neighborhood)
   - Existing road conditions
   - Land acquisition requirements
   - Local labor and material costs

2. **Benefit Estimates**: Conservative estimates that don't include:
   - Reduced traffic congestion
   - Decreased road maintenance costs
   - Property value increases
   - Tourism and economic activity boost
   - Improved air quality beyond CO2
   - Noise reduction benefits

3. **Data Gaps**:
   - City-specific modal share data limited
   - Pre/post implementation studies scarce in Indian context
   - Long-term maintenance costs not included

- **713 km** of cycle tracks developed nationally
- **1,740+ km** of smart roads constructed/improved
- **3,500+ km** of neighborhood streets identified for NMT
- **Mission concluded**: March 31, 2025

### Investment Comparison

**Metro Rail Investment**:
- Since 2010: ₹20 trillion ($241 billion) invested
- Through 2026: ₹3 trillion ($36 billion) projected

**NMT Infrastructure** (this analysis):
- 5 cities: ₹1,531 Crores ($184.5 million)
- Cost per person reached: ₹617 ($7.44)
- ROI: 52.76:1 over 20 years

## Policy Recommendations

### Short-term (1-2 years)

1. **Secure Funding**: Allocate ₹1,531 Crores for 5-city program
2. **Adopt NMT Policies**: Cities without NMT policies should follow Chennai's model
3. **Technical Partnerships**: Engage ITDP for design and implementation support
4. **Pilot Projects**: Start with high-visibility arterial roads (400 km identified nationally)

### Medium-term (3-5 years)

1. **Scale Nationally**: Extend to all 117 Cycles4Change participant cities
2. **Mandate Budget Allocation**: Require 40-60% of transport budgets for NMT (Chennai model)
3. **Integrate with Transit**: Focus on metro/bus station last-mile connectivity
4. **Safety Enforcement**: Strengthen traffic laws protecting cyclists and pedestrians

### Long-term (5-10 years)

1. **Achieve 20% Bicycle Modal Share**: National target for megacities
2. **Complete Networks**: Build out 3,500+ km of neighborhood street networks
3. **Maintenance Programs**: Establish dedicated NMT maintenance budgets
4. **Behavior Change**: Launch nationwide campaigns promoting active mobility
